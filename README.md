# Welcome

## Who am I? 
Full stack software engineer with over 20 years experience in multiple industries (education, healthcare, investment) and multiple technologies (C#, React, TypeScript, SQL Server, etc.)

### My career goals:
1. Fight the bad code: my passion is rehabilitating legacy code
2. Leave a trail: communication is the most important and most overlooked software engineering trait
3. Lift up my team: be a fountain, not a drain; show up and be kind; in our industry, mental health is often neglected

### I am an advocate for:
* sustainable technical practices including test-driven development (TDD), static code analysis, SOLID principles of design, and paying attention to code smells.
* DevOps and process automation. How we create and deliver software is just as important as what we deliver.
* mentoring new developers. Starting a new position and learning how to grow is a challenge. Mentoring other developers is always a wise investment

## What keeps my attention? 
* Test-driven development - the only way to write code
* Rescuing legacy code - code is meant to be maintained
* Code as data visualizations - for analyzing code quality hot spots and getting up to speed on a new codebase faster
* Mutation testing - do you have code coverage, or do you have _code coverage_?

## What do I code in my free time? 
* [Minesweeper](https://github.com/softwareliberationarmy/minesweeper-ts-tdd-2) - TDD (test-driven development) comes pretty naturally to me with C# and dotnet, but I needed more practice working in a TDD flow in TypeScript. This was an experiment to see if I could drive out the entire Minesweeper game in React and TypeScript using TDD.
* [repo-man](https://github.com/softwareliberationarmy/repo-man) - I am very interested in code as data, and using visualizations to more quickly understand a new codebase. This was another TDD experiment based on a git repo visualization project I had found on the GitHub research site. The project is written in C# and generates an SVG file showing the relative size and file extensions of the files in a git repo. My intention was to also be able to visualize which files were most recently modified, and which files have been most often modified, but for large repositories with deep histories libgit does not perform well, so this will have to wait for another day.
