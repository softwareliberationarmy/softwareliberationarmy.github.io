Welcome to my page

## What do I code in my free time? 
* [Minesweeper](https://github.com/softwareliberationarmy/minesweeper-ts-tdd-2) - TDD (test-driven development) comes pretty naturally to me with C# and dotnet, but I needed more practice working in a TDD flow in TypeScript. This was an experiment to see if I could drive out the entire Minesweeper game in React and TypeScript using TDD.
* [repo-man](https://github.com/softwareliberationarmy/repo-man) - I am very interested in code as data, and using visualizations to more quickly understand a new codebase. This was another TDD experiment based on a git repo visualization project I had found on the GitHub research site. The project is written in C# and generates an SVG file showing the relative size and file extensions of the files in a git repo. My intention was to also be able to visualize which files were most recently modified, and which files have been most often modified, but for large repositories with deep histories libgit does not perform well, so this will have to wait for another day.
